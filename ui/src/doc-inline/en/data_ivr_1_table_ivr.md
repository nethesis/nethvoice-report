# IVR

Data broken down by *IVR* (Interactive Voice Response) during the given period.
Data are grouped according to the chosen filter criteria.

The *IVR* data shows every choice made by callers
within each IVR.

The items shown for the *IVR* data are:

- `Grouping Period`
- `IVR Identifier`: the unique identifying code of each IR
- `IVR Name`- `IVR Choice`: numeric choices made within the IVR. 
There also two extra available choices: `i` which indicated an invalid choice; 
`t` which indicates the user didn't make a choice before timeout
- `Total`: total of choices

If no IVR has been selected, all IVRs will be shown,
if no choice has been selected, all the choises will be shown.
