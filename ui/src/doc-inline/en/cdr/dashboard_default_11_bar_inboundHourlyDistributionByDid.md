Hourly distribution of *Inbound* calls by selected DIDs.

The graph shows the total number of inbound calls by selected DIDs within the set 
working hours. 

DIDs (Direct Inward Dial) are the inbound numbers that are configured and managed 
by the switchboard.

If no DID has been selected, the chart will show all available DIDs.

The chart can contain a maximum of 8 sections. The DIDs exceeding this number
will be shown in the `Others` section.
