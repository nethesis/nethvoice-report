# Average Duration of Inbound Calls by DID

Average duration of *Inbound* calls for the selected DIDs.

The pie chart shows the average duration of calls by selected DIDs 
and compares them proportionally.

DIDs (Direct Inward Dial) are the inbound numbers that are configured and managed 
by the switchboard.

The duration is the length of time, displayed in seconds/minutes/hours, 
between the call being received and its termination.

If no DID has been selected, the chart will show all available DIDs.

The chart can contain a maximum of 8 sections. The DIDs exceeding this number
will be shown in the `Others` section.

If available, click the `Show Details` button to access all the data, 
which is presented in tabular format.
