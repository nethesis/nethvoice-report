# Average Wait Time of Inbound Calls by DID

Average wait time of *Inbound* calls by selected DIDs.

The pie chart shows the average wait time of inbound calls 
by selected DIDs and compares them proportionally.

DIDs (Direct Inward Dial) are the inbound numbers that are configured and managed 
by the switchboard.

The *wait time* is the time that has passed between the call being initiated and it 
being answered.

If no DID has been selected, the chart will show all available DIDs.

The chart can contain a maximum of 8 sections. The DIDs exceeding this number 
will be shown in the `Others` section.

If available, click the `Show Details` button to access all the data, 
which is presented in tabular format.
