# Failed Calls No Agents

*Leaving queue due to lack of agents* calls data 
for the selected queues in the set period.
Data are grouped according to the chosen filter criteria.

*Leaving the queue for lack of agents* calls are calls
that failed because while they were waiting in the queue the 
number of agents online/available/free (depending on the 
configuration of the queue) has cleared and consequently have 
been pulled out of the queue.

The entries shown for calls in *Leaving queue for lack of
agents* are:

- `Grouping Period`
