# Recall

*Recall* for selected queues within the set business hours.

The line graph shows *Recalls*, calls made by agents
successfully to the numbers that have failed in the queue, in the queues
selected in the working hours set divided as selected in the filter.

If no queues have been selected, the graph will show no data.

The chart can contain a maximum of 8 sections. Queues exceeding this number
they will appear in an `Others` section.
