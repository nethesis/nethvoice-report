# Calls by Queue

*Total* calls received by selected queues.

The pie chart shows the total number of calls entered in the selected queues
and compares them proportionally.

If no queue has been selected, the chart will display all available queues.

The chart can contain a maximum of 8 slices. Queues exceeding this number will be 
aggregated on a slice named `Others`.
